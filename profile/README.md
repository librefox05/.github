# Librefox

Librefox is a customized firefox project which includes different preferences that respect user privacy as much as possible. We use preferences from betterfox and cachyOS without breaking anything.

## Notable Changes

- Sane defaults
- DuckDuckGO out of the box and other \
privacy-respecting search engines
- Auto install ublock origin
